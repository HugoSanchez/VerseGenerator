Following Jason Brownlee tutorial I am trying to build a simple RNN model that generates new rap song verses with Notoriuos BIG famous style and tweet's it automatically.

This is a work in progress.

You can find Jason's tutotial here:

I trained the models on a AWS EC2 GPU instance follwing this tutorial from Data Camp:

Any suggestions are wellcome.

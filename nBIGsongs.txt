THINGS DONE CHANGED 
Verse one:Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin smoked g, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project
Hallways, shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me thoughVerse two:No more cocoa leave-io, one two three
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kung-fu
Instead of a mac-10 he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
And we comin to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
Look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changedVerse three:If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from
And now the shit's gettin crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the sky grand pagers
Goin outta town, blowin up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed
GIMME THE LOOT 
Yeah. motherfuckers better know... huh, huh. lock your windows,
Close your doors. biggie smalls, huh... yeah.My man inf left a tec and a nine at my crib
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, g, you with me?Motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
And I'm stressed, yo biggie let me get the vestNo need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat the tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him yo don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and moveNigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing it's so hard...Yes, love love you're fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Webs on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 mom pendantI'm slamming niggaz like shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'cos mom duke ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggaz in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my gat motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggaz quick if you hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in your back and head piece
The opposite of peace sending mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Stepping to your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
'cos when I lick shots the shits is persistentHuh, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at? where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug
From the main thug, .357 slug
And my nigga biggie got an itchy one gripOne in the chamber, 32 in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel
Before you find out how blue steel feelFrom the beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater
The money getter motherfuckers don't have better
Rolex watches and colourful swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop itMan, niggaz come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get stripped down for they earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant baka! baka! baka!So go get your man bitch he can get robbed tooTell him biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it the cocksucker won't forget itMan, listen all this walking is hurting my feet
But money looks sweet (where at?) in the isuzu jeep
Man, I throw him in the beem, you grab the fucking c.r.e.a.m
And if he start to scream bam! bam!, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she thinks she a superstar
Ooh biggie, let me jack her, I kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat...
Yo chill, shorty, let me do that...
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked, gettin shot on the spot
(oh shit! the cops!) be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
(so why the fuck he keep lookin?) I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he lookin in my face
You better haul ass 'cos I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, 'cos I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot
MACHINE GUN FUNK 
So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcoreAppeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel oneCaps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgieSays who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quickerEspecially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking blunts by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, babyI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funkI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funkI live for the funk, I'll die for the funkAll I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitchesFrom staying in my business, what is this, relentless
Approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock16 shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Cause I'm knee-deep in the beatsIn the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the blue suits
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head, cause when you hit the bricksI got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, babyI live for the funk, I'll die for the funkI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funkI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funkSo I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy: the place where my head rests
50-shot clip if a nigga want testThe rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
"What's love got to do"?When I'm ripping all through your whole crew
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's selling by the tons
Niggas want to know how I live the mack lifeMaking money, smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, babyI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

All purpose war got the rottweilers by the door
And I feed em gun powder so they can devour
The criminals tryin to drop my decimals
Damn. niggaz wanna stick my for my c.r.e.a.m.
And in a dream things ain't always how it seems
It's the ones that smoke blunts witcha
See your picture, now they wanna
Grab they guns and come and getcha
Betcha biggie won't slip
I got the calico with the black talions loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put they bodies in a bad prediciment
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my beretta
Buck with what I had you with

Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode down ya rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore, c-4 to ya door no beef no more
Feel the rush, scandalous

Hold on I hear somebody comin...
READY TO DIE

(we gon' kill your ass)As I grab the glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie smalls the savage, doin your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper girl stripper the henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The q-45, glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques drippin out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave g
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a jheri curl, I'm ready to dieAs I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doin whatever it took from snatchin chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs tried to get the avenue sold
I want it all from the rolexes
To the lexus gettin paid, is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I got a glock, makin motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kickin niggaz down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggaz gettin wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns cause I'm ready, readyI'm ready to die!
(nah we ain't gon' kill your ass yet)
(we gonna make you suffer)In a sec I throw the tec to your fuckin neck
Everybody hit the deck, biggie bout to get some wreck
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talkin
You better act like cece, and keep on walkin
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung on like you slumber right you fell to the conrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, we're stompin
I'm rippin mc's from tallahassee, to compton
Biggie smalls on a higher plane
Niggaz say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
Down your backbone to where your motherfuckin cheek drip
The shit I kick, rip it through the vest
Biggie smalls passin any test, I'm ready to die!I'm ready
(time to go, we gonna put you out your misery motherfucker)
Niggaz definitely know what time it is
The notorious one in full effect
For ninety-three!
Suicidal, I'm ready!(now I lay me down to sleep)
Yeah

(if I should die before I wake)
(I pray the lord my soul to take)
(cause I'm ready to die)(all y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to)(biggie smalls the biggest man)

But lickin' clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below

Biggie Smalls is the illest
Your style is played out, like Arnold wondered
"What you talkin bout Willis?"
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White

throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like em brainless
Guns I like em stainless steel

I squeeze gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me (T-H-O-D
Man) You don't want to fuck with BiggieHere I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit

Comin where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, youse the number one contender
Lookin cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitchin, button up ya lip and

Hey, I'll be kickin, you son, you doin all the yappin

Baby accept it, utmost respect it
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles DickensWelcome to my center
Honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke
The faggot took the back way
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus(I got more glocks and techs than you)
I make it hot (Niggas won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me
tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought sorepeat 2X
EVERYDAY STRUGGLE 
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggleI don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustleAnother drug to juggle, another day another struggleI know how it feels to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sellPeople look at you like you're the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser
But they don't know about the stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to payThat's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit
I remember I was just like youSmoking blunts with my crew
Flipping oldies 62's
'Cause G-E-D was it B-I-G, I got P-A-I-D
That's why my mom hates meShe was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower movesFour drunks trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear itSmoking mad Newports 'cause I'm doing court for an assault
That I caught in Bridge Port, New York
Catch me if you can like the ginger bread man
You better have your gat in hand'Cause manI don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggleI had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to MarylandWith my man Tutex to take over this projects
They call him Tutex, he tote two techs
And when he starts to bust
He likes to ask who's next?I got my honies on the Amtrack
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hun to make some quick cashI told her she could be lieutenant bitch got gassed
At last I'm literally lounging Black,
Seating back counting double digit thousands stacks
Had to re-up see what's up with my peepsToyota dealer cars had it cheap on the jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone callIt couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated
Like Nino at the Carter
I heard Tec got murdered in a town I've never heard ofBy some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her where she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy should be home in threeUntil them I look south for the home family
A true G, that's me blowing like a bubble
In the everyday struggleI don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggleI'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't trying to see no black man turn into John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge I'm gonna mold 'er now
Trick 'er little dope buying young girls tringesDealing with the dope fiend binges
Seeing syringes in the veins
Hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke makes my brain feel so strange
Breaking days on the set no sweat from cold moet
Can't bag yet because's still wet
But when I dry back in five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line
I had to burst on the third
Rehearse that's my word
Thinking the game Ds knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no!
Even though they had me scared
Yo they gotta eight I gotta teck with air holesThat's just how the shit goes in the struggle mother fuckerI don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle

You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's d*ck (yeah)
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife (uh, yeah)
Got no rings and sh*t, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my b*tch, the one who'd never snitch (uhh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy f*ckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you rightChorus: Notorious B.I.G.Just me and my b*tch (variations repeat to next verse)(Girl)

(Girl)
Why would I do that?
(Puff Daddy)
Yo don't lie to me motherf*ckerVerse Two: Notorious B.I.G.Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna b*tch that like to play celo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real b*tch is all I want, all I ever had (yeah, c'mon)
With a glock just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the b*tch belongs with me
Any plans with another b*tch, my b*tch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick b*tch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we f*ckin die togetherChorus(Girl)
Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch your a$$ f*ckin around

Ain't no jokes
(Puff Daddy)
Yo, don't don't play with my d*ckVerse Three: Notorious B.I.G.She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger (yeah)
One day, she put nine one one on the page
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major (yeah)
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my sh*t was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my b*tch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me (uh, yeah)
And when I find em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my b*tchChorusUh, yeah, yeah
Uh...

Verse 1
~~~~~~~Nineteen-seventy somethin', nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms'd hurry up so I could get buck
Wild, juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New york new york, ready for the likes of this, uh
Then came the worst date, may 21st
2: 19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seein' my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said, he's gonna be a bad boyVerse 2
~~~~~~~Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream at my lifetime dream, I mean
I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of new york, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bailVerse 3
~~~~~~~Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'
Honeys is tantalizin', they freak all night
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas livin' street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'
In the streets without a gat? nah, nigga you're slippin'
If I'm pimpin on the f with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the tec
Respect to the mac's and the ac's
To the freaks in the jeeps, lick shots to my peeps
FRIEND OF MINE 
Intro
~~~~~No... fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my
Niggas know... junior mafia click, gucci don, you know how we play.
Fuckin' skanless-ass bitches. you know how it go boots... i
Meet a bitch, fuck a bitch, next thing you know you fuckin'
The bitch. you just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like
A cold and shit. fuck'em.Verse 1
~~~~~~~Now when I'm fuckin' those jen I'm invincible
Don't love no hoe, that's my priciple
'cause uh, bitches come [and uh] bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fuckin' door
[you know] they might be the one to set me up
Wanna get their little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote tecs and stuff to get'em off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leavin'
Bitches be schemin', I kid ya not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my glock cocked
One hoe said, big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend bitch
'cause when I like ya, then ya go and fuck my friend bitch
[and you know that ain't right]Chorus
~~~~~~You know that ain't rightWith a friend of minex4Verse 2
~~~~~~~You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep'em in flavours like timbo's and jibbo's
Bitches just like to play the mary though
[yeah we know, drop the scenario]
It was me, dee, the mpv
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some wu-tang
M-e-t-h-oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the gee's obsolete
Don't sleep! banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
That's my nigga dee, damn he got gee
Now she fuckin' him and fuckin' me, see
You know that ain't rightRepeat chorusVerse 3
~~~~~~~Uh... now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruisin' up the block, I be passin' her
Pimpin' hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and dee blunted up, pissy, schemin' on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's sayin' I dissed her 'cause I'm fuckin' her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin' family
She fucked my man dee, so why she mad at me?
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass
UNBELIEVABLE 
Verse one:Live from bedford-stuyverson, the livest one
Representin bk to the fullest
Gats I pull it, bastards duckin when big be buckin
Chickenheads be cluckin in my bathroom fuckin
It ain't nuttin, they know big be handlin
With the mac in the ac' door paneling
Bandaging mc's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve, red boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the q-45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my cluthes get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya, but I have ta, you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like kwame, and them fuckin polka dots
Who rock the spot? biggie!
You know how the weed yo, unbelievableVerse two:B-i-g, g-i-e, aka, b.i.g.
Get it? biggie
Also known as the bon appetit
Rappers can't sleep need sleepin big keep creepin
Bulelts heat-seekin, casualties need treatin
Dumb rappers need teachin
Lesson a - don't fuck with b-i, that's that, oh i, thought he was wack
Oh come come now, why y'all so dumb now
Hunt me or be hunted, three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To summer sautee, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down biggie's hallway
My forte causes caucausians to say
He sounds demented, car-weed scented
If I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no-one
Call me evil, or unbelievableVerse three:Buck shots out the sun roof of lexus coupe's
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear
Mc's fear me, they too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Tryin to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice, for the nicest mc
Niggaz know the steelo, unbelievable

HOLD YA HEAD 
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and diedWoman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and diedWhen I die, fuck it I wanna go to (hell)
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortionWoman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and diedI swear to God I just want to (slit) my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm (dead), a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe (suicide's) on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my liesWoman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and diedI reach my peak, I can't speak,
call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'
THE MOST SHADY 
[ Verse 1 ] [ Eminem ]It has been said, that there has been known to be blood shed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead
Strapped to beds, bite bombs dynamite lead
Money, power, respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary aint it? Picture yourself going out as a hero
Picth a Mural, pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
So many piggy bank off of, Biggie's back and Pac's
Landmarks, history in rap, statistically in fact
It's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left of March 9th to come from such hard knock lifes
And make it out of the bottom to hit the spotlights
Once the artist, this is our lives
Cast out for all eyes
And he who lasts the longest must be the strongest
In this concrete jungle
Where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
This origin, which is usually originated from cats are starving
Or it could just be somebodys aura that just horrifies
And applies to his persona or the sizes in his entourage
That intimidates the people to the point
You know that he's gangster, he aint gotta say shit you just believe it[ Verse 2 ] [ Obie Trice ]Since Big taught us niggas to think big
I'm been about my business since then so it aint Cheers
It aint how we live, it's what he said he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I've experienced in the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes there's no limit in them skies
When Ready 2 Die was a sick part of my life
Pummin that .45, plotting to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican, I'd so many times Rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs?
No pop of mine could top Big Poppas rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh?
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga P.I[ Verse 3 ] [ P Diddy ]I took a coal, a diamond, I moulded his mind, enter
The most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my designs impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lash, said I made a fortune of his past an'
All is did was build a dynasty off of his passion
And I'm addressing the adolesence absent to who he is
The original king of New York Christopher Wallace
This is a promise on Diddy's honor
I'm a father to ya'll and teach ya with all the drama
Don't even bother, or repeat
All of your albums play back to back
And I visit your grave cause our friendships intact
An ammaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling God bless
Regardless to critics yelling that 'east-west'
I seen the game loosing, I'm just pressing the reset
When the ressurection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough, doing the same crown of thorns literally
I'ma pay homage, brooklyns finest
Wether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, ni99a!

THE FUNK 

GET YOUR GRIND ON 
But I would've loved to hear

We have our day, you know?
I seen him, I seen him, I seen him at the pearly gates, yaknahmean?
We keep it, keep it, keep it going from thereUhh, I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set up
Shoulda pushed 'em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shands in Brook-land
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin BASTARD
Cryin, know my friends is lyin
Y'all know who killed 'em filled 'em with the lugars from they Rugers
or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apoligies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and stillNigga still gotta get his grind on
Come get introduced to my home
I grew up in the crime zone
Soon as you grown, you on your own, you keep your strap
You keep your chrome cause the streets is chilly
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my home
A nigga grew up in the pro-jects, end up gettin mo' stressed
Mo' money, mo' drama you know a nigga keep his armor
Cause the streets are killin
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my homeYo, yo
The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me 'til I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
and rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggaz talk but they babble cause they ain't sayin nuttin
If ain't blazin somethin with the mac I'm in the shack bakin muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin; my Squad been waitin
for the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin
An orgi-nation of veterans built
with genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills
Invest in the real, don't get left in the hills
My tech and my steel turn your whole crew into vega-ta-bills
We blessed with the will to never surrender
cause my every agenda's in and out, unseen like I entered the ninja
It's my worldI got that new F-N, call it that faggot nigga gun
Couple of hollow tips make you faggot niggaz run
Crack pull up, everybody clear out
Anybody pumpin that rock is gettin aired out
I'm in that caddy with my bitch in the pack
Your mommy got a body but she itchin to clap
And I know you pitchin purple but we switchin the packs
Listen, don't make me hurt you I'm just givin the facts
On that I 9-5 swirvin to a town near you
My niggaz watch out for that Black Surburbans
And no it's not the Feds, man papi's home
And papi got it good, he could put you on
Listen, I done made abandoned blocks look hot
Nine to ten Benzes, a couple of drops
Couple of rubber bands from the corrupt cops
Just to see my niggaz eat and shit and huggin the blocks
Crack a chestize 'em, right besides 'em
In front of a hundred million viewers, shouldn't surprise 'em
We from the Bronx where the may-ors lift up
And niggaz get shot in broad day cause we don't give a...
Fuck little niggaz on bike and just shoot you
All for a pair of some Nikes, the shits brutal
I done seen fiends O.D., shot the wrong pack
Then they call the shit the bomb smack
Word to Crack, the god body, the hard body, the realest ever
The John Gotti, this rap shit, will it kill me? NeverThis goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team-and
be Mor-gan than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces
Fuck the screwfaces, cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggaz can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly (what)
To old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what) specialize
in killin wives and grandmothers, who ya trustin, shit
When Frank start bustin, Frank start somethin
Killin ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin broads home
On the phone with the chip, with these Cristal chicks
Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit
LIVING THE LIFE 
To my motherfuckin' man, fifty grand, the alcholic man
Inject a tall can to his blood stream, if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
Emcee prover, the chocolate tah smoker (huh?)
I like to mack in Maximas and Acuras
Your girl's butt cheeks, I'm smackin' (huh?)
The raw rapper, spot smacker
Wit the lil hooker on my lap-ah, you know your favorite macker
A shy nigga, but I ain't ya fuckin' comforter
And If I ever fall in love, I better fuck wit her
Ask the hooker, If I didn't juk her
She try to front, then I put the Chucky Booker on her
(Why you wanna... play games on me?)
Bitch, you crazy? Commitments, I'm Swayze
No time for the ill shit
Mess with the niggaz on that real blood spill shit
My rappin' tactics, are drastic
Stretch these motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my Pedigree,
You better be filled with energy
Niggaz never gettin' me
Big cities and bright lights
Short days and long nights
No stress and no strife
I'm high off living the life
It's clear to see that I'm the motherfuckin' man,
I done learned from the best of em;
Took the first slot, niggaz still second guessin' em
Hoes, I'm undressin' em', foes, I'm not stressin' em'
Outlastin' a bunch of 'em, outflaw'd the rest of em'
Cuz everyday, I stay preachin' on the pulpit
So tell them haters they could miss me with that bull-shit
But I won't miss, I'm Luda, the heat holder
I'm rich, bitch! I've done more shows than Oprah
And I'm a soldier, ready for whatever
Roll with a bunch of niggaz that don't know no better
King like Coretta, countin' mo' cheddar
Just hired two dykes to be my ho getters
When it comes to these women, dog, ain't no one fuckin' wit me
They runnin' back, you think I had TJ Duckett wit me
That's cause I throw it like Vick, from the yard line
Menage a trois, it's safe to say I'm havin' hard times
To my nigga Chopper dot, with the whoopty-whop on the block
Got the heaters cocked, cause I know the suckers on the block
Hennesey and Belve-D, brings a lot of jealousy
Nigga stop snitchin', nephew, why you tellin' me?
They say the game ain't what it use to be no more
He used to be a G, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names (snitch)
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Ya'll fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, that's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me Snoopy Trump
I keep my heater close, cause I love to bust
Now I susstain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga; I'm livin' the life!
SOMETHIN 
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'1970 somethin' nigga I don't sweat the date my moms was late,
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins,
In this world the fly girls, Tanqueray and Hennesey,
Until I call Earl, 10 months in this gut, what the fuck,
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild,
Juvenile with the mics 'n' shit, New York, New York, ready for the likes of this,
Then came the worst date, May 21st, 2:19 was when my momma water burst,
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,
Umbilical cords wrapped around my neck,
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step,
I made it out i'm bringin' mad joy,
The doctor looked and said he's gonna be Bad Boy!I remember back in time,
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,
Before I even got my ride
Before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhereWould 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God to reverse it I give my left eye,
With the right I visualized, the king of Bed-Stuy,
Checkin' his daughter Tianna into junior high,
If I was in Brooklyn, and B.I. Was still alive, in 2006 it might sound like this,
N.&. 718 212, where Sue's rendevouz,
Its like Moulin Rouge,
High fashion, up town Air Force Ones,
And Vasquez, Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Lace Dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S Classes,
For you bastards, catch a cab to Manhattan,
With that Broadway actin', you hype that
belly shit'd get you capped, and wrapped in plastic,
Tell the captain, ask Rog' what's happennin',
Out here nor speak no evil, inside the MagnumI remember back in time,
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,Now I'm 13 smokin' blunts, makin' green,
Or on the drug scene, fuck the football team,
Risk it, ruptured spleens, by the age of 16,
Hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream,
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my doe up,
So school I didn't show up, and fuck my flow up,
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself,
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself,
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! I couldn't see it,
Scarface king of New York, I wanna be it,
Rap was secondary, money was necessary,
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary,
C74 mark 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate,
Time to contemplate, damn were did I fail,
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail,I remember back in time,
Before all the homies died,
Before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,
Before I even got my ride
Before I had nickels and dimes
I knew that I was goin' somewhere

LIVING IN PAIN 
Welcome to the house of pain, Just Blaze niggaz
Theres no we, it seems I can't get free
Sombody tell me what's happenin to me
The country bud got me chokin
I'm on a mission to the point motherfuckers think I'm smokin
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the H-shot fifth
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that killin is thrillin
All the blood spillin, is all up on the drug dealin
A broad gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug
So when he lit shots
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the Mac .11's swingin from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain
I'm livin in a house of pain
Is anybody listenin and tell me can you can see this God be surroundin me
Now it's gettin colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin hard to breathe
And it's gettin blury, I'm gettin worried cause it's gettin hard to see
When your lampin in the house of paaaiiinnn
When the motherfucker dust kicker, who can you trust?
Who gave you the heart to see a nigga?
Before you bust, my name is spoken on the tongue so many foes
Bustin motherfuckers out the blocks and I ain't even go
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame
From doin fix to bustin tricks out the fuckin frame
Got these bitches on my jock niggaz on my block
Jealous ass suckers got it duckin for my fuckin glock
And bustin niggaz ass is to stay alive
Skinny ass playa watchin victim motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin? how I'm a hustler?
Buckin busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggaz got they AK's headin for the bird
Aimin at free ass bitches let 'em rain
Givin 'em, wettin 'em, welcome to the house of pain
MJB, be worried niggaz, yea, Nas...Wendy Williams say I stayed dust maybe I should
cuz these rappers'll have your phone tap like Savion Glover
And on the West the police corrupt, some are bloods
But these Teflon I loaded explodin some mugs
I'm like Furious in "Boyz In the Hood"
But at the drive through I'm ain't runnin I'm dumpin
Crazy like a paru and load up, know how Nas do
I'm callin Henchmen to save shit, to organize a black truth
And we party hard party wit Nas
Since they ain't no more - Mardi Gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize
Ya'll yellin my name but y'all soon die in
Tryin to portray real but they be ly-in
Cuz they want the real niggaz to die so they can game
But neva that, this ain't neva lastin this is the house of pain
WANT THAT OLD THING BACK 
Uh yeah, Bad Boy baby
Biggie Smalls
Listen...
Uh yeah baby oooooooh, listen to me, oh yeaaaah
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or boy-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin "Ay papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggaz gettin mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back
What you wanna do?
I got that old thing back
What you wanna see?
Baby sing relax and feel
What you be, where you are
You wouldn't start
Bitches screamin they want That old thing back
Like B I Double G I E
Wit some new R-U-L-E
Notorious known to bustin in ya E-Y-E, baby baby!
Bitches know they love and hate me
I come, you come, we come, with back some maybe
How close we came to come the ghetto is crazy
How come you ain't,?? semi your faces
When I come you be cryin like I'm killin ya bitches
Knows when picture in the camera rollin
Cause I only be knowin how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin I got my swagger back
I'm lookin like bitch, my swagger never left
It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Shit...
Is my mind playin tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin nightmares of girls killin me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot
But lickin clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase em, I replace em

Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin fantasies without that nigga Mr. Walk
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin for an intermission
Fuck the kissin, lickin down to your belly button, I ain't frontin
They don't call me B.I.G. for nuttin, all of a sudden
Biggie Smalls

Bad Boy for life

You see I don't sweat

bitches just like to play the Merigo (yer we know drop the scenario)
it was me, D, the MPV, the blunts and brew things knockers and Wu-Tang, M.E.T.H.
O shit, look at those lips and hips on that bitch
we hit the crib so I can drop my macadoshar shit like the bluntclip
and recognize a pimp read mr speak the G's obsolete don't sleep bang the skims in the week

we gonna fuck 'till 6 in the morningNow I play her far like a move player star
she still sweatin me hard because I'm a rap star
I be cruisn up the block I be passin her pimpin hard with the female passenger
and the only time I call to hang, is when me and deep blood is up scheming on the gangbang
she shoulda used her intuition then she wouldn't be classified in that position
listen she sayin I dissed her coz I'm fuckin her sister
a message to the fellers that gets some piss UH
but she started that fuckin family
she fucked ma man D so why she mad at me?
Fuckin sister look better than you, give head better than you, pussy, gets wetter than you
so break the fuck out like a rash
I glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty assRed bones to lift ons dubies hip huggers to show off ya booty I'm hangin with
the best of them sleep
if you want I'm a veteran when I show up to the club it's VIP
I'll be dancin in the club if it's B.I.G
I'm not lookin' to find a wife - just someone to make a friend of mineI roll up off rack and polla
I'm so high when I walk in the club
I see this chick that used to get the dick

pop bubble smoke dope in ma hotel

JUST A MEMORY 
Its Bad Boy bitch
Scram Jones... the Clipse... B.I.G.
Let's go
Niggaz in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all
Big don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)
I spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)
You're nobody till somebody kills you (I don't wanna die)
Do you know where your going too
Just a memory... everybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK
May you rest in peace
Your nobody till somebody kills youDo you know where your goin too
Just a memory... so you better pack a pistol
Everybody dying, death controls y'all
Your nobody till somebody kills you
Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows
My back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk
Spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggaz, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamour that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)
On the flipside, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing
Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was laudering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because Im a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She damn near sent me to my room
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uhh
Biggie Duets...
Born Again...
Life After Death...
Legacy lives on.and on, and on
These motherfuckers still can't see you BIG

Motherfuckers...
RUNNING YOUR MOUTH 
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?1, 2, 3, and...Now they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plently dough man
Icy Audemar, hendy gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bently door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told u he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coup's up take the new Lame for a sec
12" up, new cane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer and a coozie
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the uzziThey talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and counting
Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it cause she running her mouthShe want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouthFuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing
I mark with death, hard to kill like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?Ah, Yo
Now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dieing
Now same niggasare idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors
All in your house nigga, our strategies is different from yours
Listen, you come you can do it while I continue to preach
Snoop, fam, bigger Bust of the stand if you can't reachRun for your gun you suckers
B.I.G. I'm a get them motherfuckers
Don't you worry about a thing, bang-bang-boogie
I got a few chickens that's gon' work that noggie
In the lack with a sack go and put it on the mat

Gun in your mouth, motherfucker quit running your mouthWhat you really want from a nigga?...

Cause real g's know the feeling (It's Murda)
It's hard body, no remorse for the killing (Weezy)
Mad trees and bitches in dungarees
The city under seas, kitchen 100 degrees
I love that summer breeze, I'll stand in it until it freeze
I'm from another breed, them sss, southern g's
I sip phemetrazine, I lean, I stand tall
I'm mean, I'm mad raw, I'm coming like fastball
Steee-rike, Yup, so get it right
Nigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife
In a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat schwork
So be smart and play your own part
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell
Hey, I'ma shoot it out if I'm facing the ail
Yea, so tell your girl to come and make me rich
Weezy Baby nigga, 9 to 5, 10 to 6
All night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
(Watch it) I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight
I'm with whatever, It'd be your life before my life
At night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Got my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?
It's showdown time, throwdown time
Same d-off, four pound time
Clack Clack, go get yours, I'll go get mine
Check it man, I'm wit whatever
Goodness gracious the paper
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
I'll blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me
You got nothing on a nigga like me, you'll see
I'm on the grind from sun up to sun down
If I'm lying, may lightning come down and strike me right now
I'll turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred
Keep it coming til I'm full on my stomach
I'm stuck in my ways, I'm stuck puffing my hase
Hand on my pistol, front of it sprays
I'm stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga
Trying to get rid of the life, alright?
ULTIMATE RUSH 
Uh (uh)

Damn sir, sniff me like the coke, three lines, me one, give you none

Hit 'em and forget 'em and go handle my businessI like the kind of whine and dine, who grindin all the time
Yo ex girl was a fly, but now lucked up on a dime nigga?? with you, all you wanna do is lay around
And stay around and get mad when I play aroundI like to lay never work, put your money in my purse
To the mall, I go search matchin shoes for my skirtTuesday I saw you on the zee, but you still wanna get wit me
Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends sayMe and my friends got your Benz, attractin mens
And spendin dividends, blowin like the windSo I guess you think I'm slippin cause I ain't flippin
Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be trippinI ain't trippin nor flippin, I'm just liquor sippin
At the bar, tippin wit your money, can you pay the difference?It seems like it's a waiste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jump in every car, except for minesNigga, I don't jump in cars, I'm a super star
Face way to flaw, you should hang me on your wallAll I do all day is drink Tanqueray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your faceMake me smile, see them teeth, me look cute down to them features
My waste, my physique, me don't want freak-a-leekShould I whine and dine? You put ring on your fingers
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingersSex will never linger, hold up, put up the blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers, give yo ass the middle fingerYou better slow your role baby, you ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pin number, just page me when you will baby

Settin up shop, it's hands on in the hustle
Fakes don't kill nuttin but time and don't tussle
The process of elimination, fresh rotation

In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory
The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief

WOULD YOU DIE FOR ME 

COME ON 

RAP PHENOMENON 
"Meth-Tical."
"Biggie. Biggie." (mmmhmmmmmm)Uhh. uhh. uhh. (yo c'mon Big) uhh.
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
The prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
Is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
Or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
But they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutchin, your chest-plate contemplate
You 'bout to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands highYo. yo yo
I don't brownnose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trustin niggas since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
Yo Biggie (what? what?) She havin my bay-bayy
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high"This rule is so underrated." -]
"Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin" -
"Ain't no other kings in this rap thing." -
"Biggie, a motherfuckin rap phenomenon" -Uhh, uhh
I got a new mouth to feed, I'm due South with keys
Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, andyou don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cee's advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
From Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off "Get Money", "Player's Anthem"
Don't forget, "One More Chance" and, my other hits, other shit
Niggas spit be counterfeit, robbery come actually
In and out like fuckin rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often
Frank Wizzard, fuck you soft or fragilla
Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
Slash Gorilla, slash illest turned killerNow now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
That's infinity -- too many sick niggas, nickel nines;
Bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty
Unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot em with a dart like Cupid
Until they got love for my music
Star Wars I'm Han Solo, with three egoes
And three charges, I got to "See-three-P.O.'s"
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
Eyeball blower with no equal, niggas swingin swords in the WAR
That's my people, sho' nuff, befo' I roll up
This is a hold up, hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie? The Notorious
Jeee-zus, "Unbelievable" rhyme that reaches
And touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin
Hot -- forcin my way up in the door
To kill the bullshit like a matador
Keep your hands high (what?)
LET ME GET DOWN 

TONIGHT 

IF I SHOULD DIE BEFORE I WAKE 
Notorious B.I.G. F/ Beanie Siegal, Black Rob, Ice Cube
Miscellaneous
If I Should Die Before I Wake
[Notorious B.I.G.]
Uhh. UHH
Yeah.
Uhh. uhh.
Uh! Yeah. yeah.
Uhh.
I'm on.
Fuck em. yeah, uhh.
With my hands gripped. praise the Lord shit
Fuck her, never knew her
Screw her. (dump her body, dump her body) sewer
Our father. uh-huh.What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
Uhh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
and my body start to shake, if I should die before I wakeChorus: Notorious B.I.G. (repeat 2X)With my hands gripped. praise the Lord shit
Our father. if I should die before I wake[Black Rob]
Fluck that
Snap a nigga shit, smash him with the fifth, watch his body lift
Shut his hottie's lips, bitch screamin, hit her body quick
Got me like the trifest not knowin how my life is
My life is, rap sheet long as the Turnpike
The sheistest, hey fella, who bidded with the lifers
Did it with the glocks, spit it witcha pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher; mad you can't be like us
Some murderers who turn bikers -- see Biggie Smalls
recruited these snipers -- alumni do it just like us
Some pied pipers, squeezin life out y'all
It's all out war, be all wild as all outdoor
If a coward got beef, y'all be checkin his palm
Paralyzin my niggaz thorough kid, how bout yours?
Real quick to screw a nigga then, hop out four
Clean the wipers, hit the party up and, hop out yours
Bitch nigga. whoah.Chorus[Beanie Siegal]
Yo when you fuckin wit Mac, you fuckin wit the best
Still wall to wall with them dusty Tecs
Man you know how I handle my shit, S.K. can on my shit
Jump out of vans like Hannibal Smith
Man I spit a thousand rounds, your squad don't need it
Shredders in a riot pump leave you quadriplegic
When I squeeze don't breathe keep it lined and even
So when niggaz get hit, they be cryin screamin
Lyin bleedin -- from that iron steamin
And I ain't tryin to hear that bullshit, I ain't mean it
Niggaz start bitchin, when that pistol in they face
or I sick two puts to come and get you in your place
If I catch you in my shit, I'm wakin my bitch
Hear take this shit, crackin the brick, facin that shit
Takin two sniffs, grabbin my shit
Best believe if I get hit, y'all niggaz takin some shit
Picture niggaz takin my shitChorus[Ice Cube]
Niggaz never thought they'd see Cube and Biggie
in the year 2000, all drunk and pissy
off whiskey, you can miss me, actin gay
He's the King of New York, I'm the King of L.A.
Doin it the O.G. way; it's sorta like
the Brooklyn Way, it's just the crook in me
So this is dedicated to the memory of
the Notorious One, the glorious one
And if you go for your gun, I got to go for mine
Cock my nine, and seperate yo' head from yo' spine
So, "Grab yo' dicks if you love hip-hop" and
fuck you niggaz that shot Big Pop'
The conspiracy, of this nation, for assassination
of the young black male in this black hell
And I can tell, no matter the weather
that you and Tupac got yo' shit together
California LoveChorus

You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it goin on
You're dead wrong[notorious b.i.g.]
Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail mary full of grace. smack the bitch in the face;
Take her gucci bag and the north face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, the vapors
Who's the one you call mr. macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} niggaz need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember shit! just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Suckin on the tits! had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of house of pain and bobby brown
I was humpin around and jump-in around
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, b-i-g
Then I bust in her e-y-e (yo big, you're dead wrong)Chorus 2x + I don't care what nobody say sample (4x at start)[notorious b.i.g.]
When I get dusted, I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech g
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push. me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?Chorus 2x + I don't care what nobody say sample (4x at start)[puff] ladies and gentlemen.[eminem]
There's several different levels to devil worshippin: horse's heads,
Human sacrifices, canibalism; candles and exorcism
Animals havin sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin, meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin, I got a nine in my pocket
And baby I'm just, dyin to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall
Red on the ceilin, red on the floor, get a new whore
Met on the second, wet on the third;
Then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrongChorus 2x + I don't care what nobody say sample (4x at start)Chorus repeats to fade.[puff daddy]

MSWALLACE (OUTRO) 
Hi I'm Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mom
I wish to thank you for your kind words
You warm gestures and your constant support over the years
I also need to share with you a few words about my son
Please take a few moments and listen
I hope you gain something from it, thanksAs a child Christopher was outspoken
When it suited him at times he was quiet
And of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
As a young man he likes to do everythingHe liked to read, he liked to be with his friends
As young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
Everything that would make him happy or comfortable
He would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and familyHis early inspirations toward rap music were
The LL's of the world, the Sugar Hills, the Mr. Magics
And the Fat Boys of the rap channel
Those were all the things I heard in the houseEven though I called it noise and banging
I know now, it is a accepted musical art form
I was a single parent, I raised my son on my own
His father had no influence on his decision
Towards the musical outlet or career he choseMy son had a mind of his own, even if his father was around
He would have turned to rap he loved music, he loved rap
At a point in my sons life he developed paranoia
About death and about the dyingWe are living in a world of imperfect human beings
Where greed, jealousy and envy
Are manifested by what others have accomplished in life
My son was very very much aware of thatHe appreciated his station in life on the directions
In which he was going or traveling
On the other hand there were others
Who I should use the hip hop phrase player hatingAnd I think that is what resulted in his paranoia
If I had to change anything in my sons life
That would have allowed him to be here today
I would have deterred him from a career in musicI'm aware that millions appreciate his music, millions loved his music
Be that it may if he hadn't chosen that lifestyle, that career
My son would be alive today
If I could sum up Christopher in one word the word would be generousThe thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that
He was in a position to help, position to share
Position to give to others who needed, to others who wanted
To others appreciated the gifts that he gave
NASTY BOY 

UNBELIEVABLE 
Verse one:Live from bedford-stuyverson, the livest one
Representin bk to the fullest
Gats I pull it, bastards duckin when big be buckin
Chickenheads be cluckin in my bathroom fuckin
It ain't nuttin, they know big be handlin
With the mac in the ac' door paneling
Bandaging mc's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve, red boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the q-45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my cluthes get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya, but I have ta, you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like kwame, and them fuckin polka dots
Who rock the spot? biggie!
You know how the weed yo, unbelievableVerse two:B-i-g, g-i-e, aka, b.i.g.
Get it? biggie
Also known as the bon appetit
Rappers can't sleep need sleepin big keep creepin
Bulelts heat-seekin, casualties need treatin
Dumb rappers need teachin
Lesson a - don't fuck with b-i, that's that, oh i, thought he was wack
Oh come come now, why y'all so dumb now
Hunt me or be hunted, three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To summer sautee, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down biggie's hallway
My forte causes caucausians to say
He sounds demented, car-weed scented
If I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no-one
Call me evil, or unbelievableVerse three:Buck shots out the sun roof of lexus coupe's
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear
Mc's fear me, they too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Tryin to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice, for the nicest mc
Niggaz know the steelo, unbelievable
LIFE AFTER DEATH INTRO 
Previously, on Ready to Die
... me and her sister had somethin goin on
(Ayo, would you listen to me motherfucker?)
I reach my peak, I can't speak
Call my nigga Cheek, tell him that my will is weak
(Ayo c'mon nigga, cut that)
I'm sick of niggas lyin,
I'm sick of bitches hawkin
(Ayo, yoyo Big, ayo chill)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin *gunshot*
*Life After Death piano and music comes in*
*heartbeat slows, sound of ambulence sirens*
*sound of pulse monitor and breathing machine*
Damn... we was spose to rule the world baby
We was unstoppable!
The shit can't be over, no
The shit can't be over man
I know you hear me nigga
I know you hear me
You got too much livin to do
Too much unfinished business
It ain't over
*flatline*
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA DIE 
I'm sittin in the crib dreamin about leer jets and coupes
The way salt shoops and how they sell records like snoop
Oops!
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3: 52, who the hell is this?
I gets up quick
Cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin
Then proceed to walkin
Its a face that I seen before
My nigga sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it
I look deeper
I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin or speakin?
He tells me c-rock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful
Is he in critical?
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
Cuz I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit
Puff won't even know what happened,
If it's done smoothly
Silencers on the uzi
Stash in the hooptie
My alibi, any cutie
With a booty that done fuck the pop
Head spinnin, reminiscin bout my man c-rockSomebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kidSomebody's got ta die

Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kidFillin clips he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin
Some kid named jason
In a honda station wagon

About how much loot and crack he stackin
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
Small crew
'round the time I was locked up with you
True indeed
But yo nigga let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn where was i?
Yeah
One night in town
Blew the fuck up
D-rock went home
And jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit 'em twice
Got 'em right for the virgin white
Pistol whipped his kids
And taped up his wife
He said yo rock, set em up, no question
Wet em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction
How many shots?
Man nigga, I seen mad holes
What kinda gats?
Hitch links, cocks, and calicoles
But fuck that
I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin hustlin
And they don't be strapped
Supreme in black
Is downstairs, the engine runnin
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if yo cominSomebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know

Somebody's got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know

How it's gonna go down
Lay these niggas low-down
Slow down
Fuck all that plannin shit
Run up in they cribs
And make em catch the man n shit
See niggas like you do ten year bids
Miss the niggas they want
And murder innocent kids
Not i
One niggas in my eye
That's jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to feel my clip in his hips
Pass the chocolate
Thai
Sing ain't lie
There's jason with his back to me
Talkin to his faculty
I start to get a funny feelins
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealin
Scream his name out
Squeeze six knuckles shorter
Nigga turned around holdin his daughter

Went from ten g's for blow to thirty g's a show
To orgies with hoes I never seen befo'

Biggie, how are you gonna do it?

Look how dark it get, when ya marked with deathShould I start your breath should I let you dieIn fear you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically, I'm worser, don't front the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it

You herbs get, stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I punish em, I'm done with them
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got cum in them, cause they, nothin but dicks
Tryin to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro rock diamonds, that's sick
Got pay off my flow, rhyme with my own click
Take trips to cairo, layin with yo bitch
I know you prayin you was rich, fuckin prick
When I see ya i'ma
This goes out for those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on the king of ny
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye

Conscience of ya nonsense in eighty-eight
Sold more powder than johnson and johnson
Tote steel like bronson, vigilante
You wanna get on son, you need to ask meAin't no other king in this rap thing
They siblings, nothing but my chil'ren
One shot, they disappearin

You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the
way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridian

B.I.G., bring that ass to meChorus: repeat to fade with variations
LAST DAY 
Can I live til my last day
Hittin honies that be na-sty
Gettin money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass meYo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The Lox get
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit
Lox and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, see Luciano put the burners
to all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'allYou already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a french kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kicked the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam the flow is forbidd-en
Either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron
Lox and Poppa, turning niggaz into Jim Hoffa
Who gon stop us, it's your last joint double copper
You gettin money or your runnin from the Feds
Ain't nothin over here but sixteen and one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggaz out there got a problem this yearBefore you think of keepin me down, heatin me down
The flow like water get deepe and you drown
with no soul, many niggaz roll with no dough
Even the small Dunn got a little black hole
Your destiny is somethin you can never figure out
Niggaz is never happy til there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to play in this?
A lot are dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it got money you better get with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes divides, when dreams collide
Teams provide, war for the street to absorb
Stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind dove'll fall in love with a whoreUhh, uhh, uhh
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert Ease make MC's freeze
You wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're sup, two bricks, every cook up
We can up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
I be the mob fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
my first LP, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin promos
Break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shined to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need for mo'
I LOVE THE DOUGH

Calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make your killings clean, slugs up in betweenThey eyes, like 'True Lies', kill 'em and flee the scene

Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin' wit put bombs in yo' moms gas tankLet's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall outFuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin' real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five a piece
Enough to cop a six, buy the house on the beachSupply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin' cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now, that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attentionThese motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss, promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossedNiggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga
That breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook we can both pull burners
Make the motherfuckin' beef cookNiggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin', my life in that man hands
While he just decidin'
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocolSince it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tuscon, pushed the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a young 'un, chose not the moves wiselySharper with game, him and his crooks, called The Juxs
Heard it was sweet, 'bout three-fifty a piece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck upThat's when Ron vanished, came back, speakin' Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
Here's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby, mother, brother, slit his throatThe nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated, he mean it
Nothing to lose, tattooed around his gun woundsEverything to gain, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money and diamonds
Specially if my daughter cryin', I ain't lyin'
Y'all know the scienceNiggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' scared of a nigga
That breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein' shook we can both pull burners
Make the motherfuckin' beef cookNiggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin' my life in that man hands
While he just decidin'
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin' ain't in my protocolWe agreed to go on shootin' is silly
Because niggas could be hidin' in showers with Mac-Milli's
So I freaked 'em, the telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Astoria, I went to war with herPeeps in ninety-one, stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place, long story, Glo' sent my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was comin' for the safeNow she breakin', shut up, 112, what's shakin'?
A Jamaican, some bitches I swear, they look gay
In a black Range Rover, been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my wayPlease, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't need it
Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we 'bout to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats noticeRoom 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline, the nigga passed me kerosene
Fuck it, it's flammable, my hunger is unexplainableStrike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two, opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin' patientAs soon as she hit the door we start blastin'
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughin', I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spit around, shot the chink in the breastShe cryin', head shots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothin but Franklin faces
The spot's hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip inIt's time for us to get to dippin'
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flippin', pistol grippin', I load the clip in
The hallway, got real loud and crowdedThey walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant

A dread kid, had a baby 'fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheatin', now Drew she gotta slay herOne night, across from the corner store

TEN CRACK COMMANDMENTS 
Uhh, it's the ten crack commandments
What, uhh, uhh
Nigga can't tell me nothin bout this coke, uh-huh
Can't tell me nothin bout this crack, this weed
To my hustlin niggaz
Niggaz on the corner I ain't forget you niggaz
My triple beam niggaz, word up(Chuck D) "One two three four five six seven eight nine""TEN"jI been in this game for years, it made me a animal
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step by step booklet for you to get
your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule nombre uno: never let no one know
how much, dough you hold, cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
if that man fucked up, get your ass stuck up
Number two: never let em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence or violence
Take it from your highness (uh-huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number three: never trust no-bo-dy
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodie to mask up, shit, for that fast buck
she be layin in the bushes to light that ass up
Number four: know you heard this before
Never get high, on your own supply
Number five: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell em bounce
Number six: that god damn credit, dead it
You think a crackhead payin you back, shit forget it
Seven: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely seperated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number eight: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too
Number nine shoulda been number one to me
If you ain't gettin bags stay the fuck from police (uh-huh)
If niggaz think you snitchin ain't tryin listen
They be sittin in your kitchen, waitin to start hittin
Number ten: a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele say hell no
Cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years, on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you pass
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks
she sniffed a whole half of cake upHeard she suck a good dick, and can a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pasta bake up, word up, uhhCrack king, Frank Blizzard

SKY'S THE LIMIT 
Good evenin' ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonite?
I'd like to welcome to the stage, the lyrically acclaimed, ha
I like this young man, because, when he came out
He came out with the phrase, he went from ashy to classy
Ha, I like that
So everybody in the house, give a warm, round of applause for
The Notorious B.I.G. *clapping*
The Notorious B.I.G. ladies and gentlemen give it up for him ya'll
UhhhA nigga never been as broke as me, (I like that)
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, (besides that)
The pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
And alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga with the fake - blaow!
Why you punch me in my face? Stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin'
and hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, BIG man they never try
So we roll wid 'em, stole wid 'em
I mean loyalty, niggaz bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch
In gear - Oshkosh with blue and white dunks
Pass the bluntSky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, pressin' what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want, have What you want, be what you wantUh-huh, I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin', bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class, to Englass, pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waist and taste
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of ya melon, clear the space
Ya brain was a terrible thing ta waste
Eighty-eight long gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs wit niggaz, real life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us outSky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, pressin what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want, have What you want, be what you wantAfter realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have ta be in school by ten, I was in
Began to encounter, with my counter-parts
On how ta burn the block apart, break it down into sections
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold seperately, Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith-n-Wesson, like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my layer
While we out here, say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when ya heart's in it
And live the phrase Sky's The Limit
Motherfucker... see you chumps on topSky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, pressin what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on

She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o, she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decoratedNow, my popularity grew, in each state
Now, I got two in each state
Used to drink brew and eat steak
Now, I pop bottles with models, larger steaks on large estatesThe world is filled with pimps and hoes
We'll just talk about those I knows
(Make it hot)
The world is mine, can't you see
I'm just trying to be all I can be
(Make it hot)
Ohh, yeahYeah, Too Short
I had a whole lotta bitches in my lifetime
I been blessed with the game always say the right lines
Had a few prostitutes and if you knew the truth
They're like pimps, you can't let 'em do it to youShe ain't no sucker, I know that bitch man
She wanna be a pretty woman lovin' a rich man
Now here you come, drop top ridin'
You ain't no pimp fake nigga stop lyin'Pussy makes money, stick to the business
Think about the real motherfuckers that live it
Street life, pimp shit, make the hoe respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick that's a shameSay what you want, but I still figured
She left you 'cause you couldn't be, like them real niggaz
She was a hustler by nature and you was just faker
Than the average symps, found a badder pimp
Too ShortCrazy ass man
I never woulda bought that bitch all them cars
And all that shit you bought that hoe man
After I heard about what the bitch did nigga, knew the hoe
Man I'm thirty years old niggaAnd that bitch was hoein' when I was in 9th grades and shit
Think about that, she been around then right?
(Make it hot)
Shit, you just a rest haven for hoes, manJust the first nigga that came along when the bitch got out the pen
Bitch only fuckin' witchu 'cause you had a good ass job, nigga nerd
Treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga, she ain't nuttin' but a hoeBet you fell in love with her, man
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife, fool
Every time you turn your back that bitch is fuckin' with dem gangstas
East side, West side these are my potnahs
Do that shit, you know what I'm talkin' bout, nigga?I tell you about some real pimps and hoes
Tell you about these pimps and these hoes man
Yeah I know a few, shit, beyotch
MY DOWNFALL 

THINGS DONE CHANGED 
Verse one:Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
With the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin smoked g, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project
Hallways, shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me thoughVerse two:No more cocoa leave-io, one two three
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use kung-fu
Instead of a mac-10 he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
And we comin to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
Look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changedVerse three:If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from
And now the shit's gettin crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the sky grand pagers
Goin outta town, blowin up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed
GIMME THE LOOT 
Yeah. motherfuckers better know... huh, huh. lock your windows,
Close your doors. biggie smalls, huh... yeah.My man inf left a tec and a nine at my crib
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, g, you with me?Motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight
And I'm stressed, yo biggie let me get the vestNo need for that, just grab the fucking gat
The first pocket that's fat the tec is to his back
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him yo don't fake no moves (what?)
Treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and moveNigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart
Have his mother singing it's so hard...Yes, love love you're fucking attitude
Because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whipping
Webs on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too
Up the herring bones and bamboos
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant
Give me the baby rings and a #1 mom pendantI'm slamming niggaz like shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'cos mom duke ain't giving me shit
So for the bread and butter I leave niggaz in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fucking angel dust
When I bust my gat motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
And I'm shooting niggaz quick if you hiccup
Don't let me fill my clip up in your back and head piece
The opposite of peace sending mom duke a wreath
You're talking to the robbery expert
Stepping to your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant
'cos when I lick shots the shits is persistentHuh, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at? where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug
From the main thug, .357 slug
And my nigga biggie got an itchy one gripOne in the chamber, 32 in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel
Before you find out how blue steel feelFrom the beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater
The money getter motherfuckers don't have better
Rolex watches and colourful swatches
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop itMan, niggaz come through I'm taking high school rings too
Bitches get stripped down for they earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant baka! baka! baka!So go get your man bitch he can get robbed tooTell him biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it the cocksucker won't forget itMan, listen all this walking is hurting my feet
But money looks sweet (where at?) in the isuzu jeep
Man, I throw him in the beem, you grab the fucking c.r.e.a.m
And if he start to scream bam! bam!, have a nice dream
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car
Fur coats and diamonds, she thinks she a superstar
Ooh biggie, let me jack her, I kick her in the back
Hit her with the gat...
Yo chill, shorty, let me do that...
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block
The bitch act shocked, gettin shot on the spot
(oh shit! the cops!) be cool, fool
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts
(so why the fuck he keep lookin?) I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see central booking
Oh shit, now he lookin in my face
You better haul ass 'cos I ain't with no fucking chase
So lace up your boots, 'cos I'm about to shoot
A true motherfucker going out for the loot
MACHINE GUN FUNK 
So you wanna be hardcore
With your hat to the back
Talking about the gats in your raps
But I can't feel that hardcoreAppeal that you're screaming
Maybe I'm dreaming
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel oneCaps, I got to peel some
To let niggas know
That if you fuck with big-and-heavy
I get up in that ass like a wedgieSays who - says me, the lyrical
Niggas saying: "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle!"
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me
Just for niggas acting shifty
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quickerEspecially when I'm drunk off the liquor
Smoking blunts by the boxes, packing Glocks
It's natural to eat you niggas like chocolates
The funk, babyI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funkI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funkI live for the funk, I'll die for the funkAll I want is bitches, big-booty bitches
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches
Now I pack gats to stop all the snitchesFrom staying in my business, what is this, relentless
Approach to know if I'm broke or not
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot
Don't mean I don't tote the Glock16 shots for my niggas in the pen
Until we motherfucking meet again
I'm doing rhymes now, fuck the crimes now
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now
Cause I'm knee-deep in the beatsIn the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats
For the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the blue suits
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof
Hold your head, cause when you hit the bricksI got gin, mad blunts, and bitches sucking dick
The funk, babyI live for the funk, I'll die for the funkI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funkI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funkSo I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside
Bed-Stuy: the place where my head rests
50-shot clip if a nigga want testThe rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya
High as a motherfucking helicopter
That's why I pack a Nina, fuck a misdeameanor
Beating motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina
"What's love got to do"?When I'm ripping all through your whole crew
Strapped like Bamboo but I don't sling guns
I got bags of funk and it's selling by the tons
Niggas want to know how I live the mack lifeMaking money, smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain
I add a little funk to the brain
The funk, babyI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk

And I feed em gun powder so they can devour
The criminals tryin to drop my decimals

Teflon is the material for the imperial
Mic ripper girl stripper the henny sipper

Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
The q-45, glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it

Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave g
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a jheri curl, I'm ready to dieAs I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doin whatever it took from snatchin chains to pocketbooks
A big bad motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs tried to get the avenue sold

To the lexus gettin paid, is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I got a glock, makin motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel

Kickin niggaz down the steps just for rep

Niggaz say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
After the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
Down your backbone to where your motherfuckin cheek drip
The shit I kick, rip it through the vest
Biggie smalls passin any test, I'm ready to die!I'm ready

"What you talkin bout Willis?"

Don't tempt me (T-H-O-D
Man) You don't want to fuck with BiggieHere I am, I'll be damned if this ain't some shit

Baby accept it, utmost respect it
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen

Honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads

Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke
The faggot took the back way
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS
Excuse me, flows just grow through me

Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus(I got more glocks and techs than you)

Nigga touch me you better bust me
tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought sorepeat 2X
EVERYDAY STRUGGLE 
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggleI don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustleAnother drug to juggle, another day another struggleI know how it feels to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sellPeople look at you like you're the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser
But they don't know about the stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to payThat's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit
I remember I was just like youSmoking blunts with my crew
Flipping oldies 62's
'Cause G-E-D was it B-I-G, I got P-A-I-D
That's why my mom hates meShe was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower movesFour drunks trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear itSmoking mad Newports 'cause I'm doing court for an assault
That I caught in Bridge Port, New York
Catch me if you can like the ginger bread man
You better have your gat in hand'Cause manI don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggleI had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to MarylandWith my man Tutex to take over this projects
They call him Tutex, he tote two techs
And when he starts to bust
He likes to ask who's next?I got my honies on the Amtrack
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hun to make some quick cashI told her she could be lieutenant bitch got gassed
At last I'm literally lounging Black,
Seating back counting double digit thousands stacks
Had to re-up see what's up with my peepsToyota dealer cars had it cheap on the jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone callIt couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated
Like Nino at the Carter
I heard Tec got murdered in a town I've never heard ofBy some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her where she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy should be home in threeUntil them I look south for the home family
A true G, that's me blowing like a bubble
In the everyday struggleI don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggleI'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't trying to see no black man turn into John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge I'm gonna mold 'er now
Trick 'er little dope buying young girls tringesDealing with the dope fiend binges
Seeing syringes in the veins
Hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke makes my brain feel so strange
Breaking days on the set no sweat from cold moet
Can't bag yet because's still wet
But when I dry back in five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line
I had to burst on the third
Rehearse that's my word
Thinking the game Ds knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no!
Even though they had me scared
Yo they gotta eight I gotta teck with air holesThat's just how the shit goes in the struggle mother fuckerI don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'
I'm living everyday like a hustle
Another drug to juggle, another day another struggle
ME & MY BITCH 
(Puff Daddy)
Yo let, let, let me ask you a question yo
Yo would you kill for me?
(Girl)
Hmmm... yeah

What took you so long to answer motherf*cker?
(Girl)

(Puff Daddy)
The f*ck wrong with you b*tch?Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's d*ck (yeah)
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife (uh, yeah)
Got no rings and sh*t, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little (yeah)
But you was my b*tch, the one who'd never snitch (uhh)
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy f*ckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you rightChorus: Notorious B.I.G.Just me and my b*tch (variations repeat to next verse)(Girl)
But you know you love that a$$, don't you?

No question
(Puff Daddy)
Yo, let me ask you another question
(Girl)

(Puff Daddy)
You ever f*ck around on me?
(Girl)
Why would I do that?
(Puff Daddy)
Yo don't lie to me motherf*ckerVerse Two: Notorious B.I.G.Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna b*tch that like to play celo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real b*tch is all I want, all I ever had (yeah, c'mon)
With a glock just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the b*tch belongs with me
Any plans with another b*tch, my b*tch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet (that's nasty)
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick b*tch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we f*ckin die togetherChorus(Girl)
Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch your a$$ f*ckin around
I'ma cut your mother-f*ckin d*ck off

Ain't no jokes
(Puff Daddy)
Yo, don't don't play with my d*ckVerse Three: Notorious B.I.G.She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger (yeah)
One day, she put nine one one on the page
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major (yeah)
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my sh*t was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my b*tch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me (uh, yeah)
And when I find em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend... me and my b*tchChorusUh, yeah, yeah
Uh...
Uh, motherf*cker yeah

RESPECT 
Verse 1
~~~~~~~Nineteen-seventy somethin', nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms'd hurry up so I could get buck
Wild, juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New york new york, ready for the likes of this, uh
Then came the worst date, may 21st
2: 19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seein' my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said, he's gonna be a bad boyVerse 2
~~~~~~~Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream at my lifetime dream, I mean
I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of new york, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bailVerse 3
~~~~~~~Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'
Honeys is tantalizin', they freak all night
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas livin' street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'
In the streets without a gat? nah, nigga you're slippin'
If I'm pimpin on the f with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the tec
Respect to the mac's and the ac's
To the freaks in the jeeps, lick shots to my peeps
FRIEND OF MINE 
Intro
~~~~~No... fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my
Niggas know... junior mafia click, gucci don, you know how we play.
Fuckin' skanless-ass bitches. you know how it go boots... i
Meet a bitch, fuck a bitch, next thing you know you fuckin'
The bitch. you just pass it around and shit, pass the shit like
A cold and shit. fuck'em.Verse 1
~~~~~~~Now when I'm fuckin' those jen I'm invincible
Don't love no hoe, that's my priciple
'cause uh, bitches come [and uh] bitches go
That's why I get my nut and I be out the fuckin' door
[you know] they might be the one to set me up
Wanna get their little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote tecs and stuff to get'em off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough to catch the bus
And when I see the semen I'm leavin'
Bitches be schemin', I kid ya not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my glock cocked
One hoe said, big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend bitch
'cause when I like ya, then ya go and fuck my friend bitch
[and you know that ain't right]Chorus
~~~~~~You know that ain't rightWith a friend of minex4Verse 2
~~~~~~~You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep'em in flavours like timbo's and jibbo's
Bitches just like to play the mary though
[yeah we know, drop the scenario]
It was me, dee, the mpv
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some wu-tang
M-e-t-h-oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the gee's obsolete
Don't sleep! banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
That's my nigga dee, damn he got gee
Now she fuckin' him and fuckin' me, see
You know that ain't rightRepeat chorusVerse 3
~~~~~~~Uh... now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruisin' up the block, I be passin' her
Pimpin' hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and dee blunted up, pissy, schemin' on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's sayin' I dissed her 'cause I'm fuckin' her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin' family
She fucked my man dee, so why she mad at me?
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit your nasty ass
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS 
Hello, aw shit nigga, what the fuck time is it
Oh goddamn, nigga do you know what time it is
Aw shit, what the fuck is going on
You alright, nigga what the fuck is wrong with youWhen I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell
It don't make sense, going to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleeping all day, no getting my dick licked
Hanging with the goodie-goodies lounging in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
(You talking some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lying to my mother, even stealing out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
(Get a hold of yourself nigga)
Sucking on her chest just to stop my fucking hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them
(Naw nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
(Nigga what the fuck)
And squeeze, until the bed's completely red
(It's too late for this shit man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fucking buddha head
The stress is building up, I can't
(Yo, I'm on my way over there man)
I can't believe suicide's on my fucking mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling me
Naw you wouldn't understand
(Nigga talk to me please, man)
You see it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no coming back
(Yo, I'mma call you when I get in the car)
Should I die on the train track, like Ramo in Beat Street
People at the funeral fronting like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
(Put your girl on the phone, nigga)
She knew me and her sister had something going on
I reach my peak, I can't speak
(Yo, you listening to me motherfucker)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
(Eyo c'mon nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lying, I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talking
(BANG)Ayo Big, ayo BigHeartbeat slowing
Please hang up, and try your call again

While they makin up facts (uhh) you rakin up platsVerse Two: Notorious B.I.G.In a Commision, dont ask for permission to hit em
He don't like me, him and wild wifey was wit em
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of ... (Satan) ... they say my killin's too blatant
You hesitatin, I'm in your mama crib waitin
Duct tapin, your fam destiny
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenominal
Gun rest under the vest by the abdominal
hum a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone -- Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matoes, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin shit
Ooops Cristal keep spillin shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me
The mo shady, Frankie baby, fantastic
Graphic, tryin to make dough, like Jurassic
Parked in quick to spark kids who start shit
See me, only me
The Underboss of this holocaust
Truly yours, Frank WhiteChorus: Busta RhymesWe got the real live shit from front to back
To my people in the world, where the fuck you at?
Where my niggaz is at? (2X)
Where the fuck my bitches at?
Where my bitches is at?

Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might beVerse Four: Notorious B.I.G.We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heatas n the two-seaters, with two midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P-Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the kids, Peniro, sheek loops
Black Rob joined the mob, it ain't no replacin him
Niggaz step up, we just macin them
placin them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P-Diddy
Business rise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition
Nother day in the life of the ComissionChorus 2X w/ Puff talking
Aiyyo, can you hear me out

Aiyyo turn me up, nobody

No more waiting late up at night
No more havin' to fuss and fight
I'm proud to say that I will never make the same mistake
(And another one, and another one)
No more thinkin' about what you do
There's no more of me runnin' back to you
(What? What?)See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to youSee my days are cold without you
(Here's another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
(And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I won't keep running back to youSome say the X make the sex spec-tacular
Make me lick you from yo neck to yo back
Then ya, shiverin', tongue deliverin'
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's alright wit' you, we fuckin'
(That's cool)
Deja Vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin' in the park
Pissy off Bacardi darkRemember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Marriott, we'd be lucky if we find a spot next to yo sister
Damn I really missed her
The way she used to rub my back when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to sweets at the Parker Meridien
Trips to the Caribbean, but tonight, no endsYou must be used to me cryin'
(Cryin')
(And another one)
While you're out bumpin' and grindin'
But I'm leaving you tonightSee my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to youYou must be used to me cryin'
(Cryin')
(And another one)
While you're out bumpin' and grindin'
But I'm leaving you tonight
(Uuh and another one)
A DREAM 
It was all a dream
Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racin through my head
It was all a dream
Felt so real to me
This is what was saidHad a dream I said, 'bout who he said?
'Bout B.I.G. I said, that's B, I.G. he said
Dig he said, proceed he said
Indeed I said, so, breathe I did
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothin'
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes I re-peated what was said
It came to me like a, well as even I said"You feel playboy," was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?
"More money, more problems, better believe it," he said
"Careful what you wish for you might receive it," he saidI see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself"
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
"Just keep doin' your thing," he said, say no moreWas it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dreamIt was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt 'n' Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, "Rap Attack," Mr. Magic, Marley MarlI let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? "Duh-ha, duh-ha"
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the,Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
Uhh, and if you don't know
Now you know, niggaWas it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream
Was it all a dream

It was all a dream
It was all, all a dream
It was all
It was all, all a dreamI see I said, jealousy I said
Got the whole industry mad at me I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself"
I agree I said, my one of a kind self
Get stoned every day like Jesus did
What he said, I said, has been said before
"Just keep doin' your thing," he said, say no more

You little haters are too jealous of us to love us
You ain't it, G-Unit made it and Obie's comin', D-Twizzy's comin'
You sick to your stomach50 percent is 50 Cent
The other 50 percent is who's color skin it is
Well, if you're even considering takin' our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't tryin' to get too intricate into itI'm just tryin' to give you a little hint for your own benefit
'Cuz then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates into some other shit
Then I'ma flip, then I'ma get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's oneIt's gonna feel like there's so many feet kickin' you
You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push meThinkin they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety

RUNNIN' (DYING TO LIVE) 
Between you and Biggie was like, who's gonna, who's gonna,
who ruled, the, the, nigga kingdom and shit basically, you know what I'm sayin'?
It was like, this is like an election...
It is an election
You know what I'm sayin'?
Me and Biggie's situation was smaller than that,
me and Biggie's situation was like...Tupac Shakur was shot several times in the chest...You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to dieCheck it, I grew up a fucking screw up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fucking blew up
Chopping rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze
celebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfuckerYou know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to dieAnd still I'm having memories of high speeds, when the cops crashed
As I laugh pushing the gas when my glocks blast
We was young, and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark when we survived through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and many wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
And these bitches they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies now the whole world trying to screw me
even the cops tried to sue me
So what can I do but stay true, sipping 22's a brewing
now the medias trying to test me got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
misery is all I see, thats my mind's state
My history with the police is shakin' the crime rate
Ma main man had 2 strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed 'Thug Life!' and emptied the clip
gots tired of running from the policeYou know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to dieI was shocked at everything! Ya know what I'm saying. I wasn't more shocked at him dying.
I was more shocked at him. Pac' is a strong dude... I know him...
You know what I'm sayin?...
Real strong... so it was when he got shot I was more like "again"
You know what I'm sayin?...
He always getting shot or shot at... He gon' pull threw this one again, make a few of records about it and its gon' be over.
You know, then when he died I was like 'Woah'... you know what I'm sayin...
it kinda took me by suprise... even though we was going threw our drama I would never
wish death on nobody! 'cause there ain't no coming back from that...
LOST BOYS 
Howdy do mother fuckaz its Weezy Baby,
Niggaz bitchin and I gotta tuck the cannon.
Listen close I got duct tape and rope,
I'll leave you missin like the fuckin O` bannons.
One hand on my money, on hand on my buddy,
That's the AK47 made his neighborhood love me.
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin,
Don't let that bird shit, he got a weak stomach.
Niggaz know I'm sick I don't spit I vomit,

Then tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um.

Bet that baby.
These other niggaz dope, I'm wet crack baby, yes.
Get back get back boy it's a set back,
Clumsy ass niggaz slip and fall into a death trap.

And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones.
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on,
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on.
Some niggaz cry wolf, I'm on that dry Cush,
And when it comes to that paper I stack books.
You heard what I said,
I can put you on your feet or put some money on your head.
Life ain't cheap,
You're better off dead.
If you can't pay the fee,

Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again.
Relax and take notes, while i take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail mary full of grace.. smack the bitch in the face;
Take her gucci bag and the north face
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, i just want the paper
The visa, kapeesha? i'm out like, "the vapors"
Who's the one you call mr. macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like camacho, i got so
Much style i should be down wit the stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} niggaz need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember shit! just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Suckin on the tits! had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess i was a combination of house of pain and bobby brown
I was "humpin around" and "jump-in around"
Jacked her then i asked her who's the man; she said, "b-i-g"
Then i bust in her e-y-e (yo big, you're dead wrong)
